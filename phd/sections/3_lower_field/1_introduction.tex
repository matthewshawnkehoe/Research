\section{Introduction}
\label{intro:chapter 3 introduction}
In the same spirit as the upper field, we present all of the necessary information to establish the analyticity of the lower field and the lower layer DNO. Our strategy is to first remove the phase from our governing equations in $\S 3.2$, introduce a domain--flattening change of variables in $\S3.3$, and then seek solutions as a joint Taylor series in two small perturbation variables: an interfacial deformation $(\S3.3)$ and a frequency deformation $(\S3.4)$. These lead to the TFE recursions $(\S3.5)$ from which we can use Sobolev space theory to establish analyticity results. The analyticity of the lower field with respect to a single interfacial deformation is established in $\S3.7$ while the joint analyticity in two small perturbations is established in $\S3.8$. The case for a single frequency deformation follows directly as a special case of Theorem $3.8.1$ and the analyticity of the lower layer DNO is proven in Theorem $3.9.2$. The chapter's conclusion employs a Fourier--Chebyshev approach to highlight interesting numerical features of our HOPS/AWE algorithm.
