\section{Introduction}
\label{intro:chapter 2 introduction}
We now present all of the information necessary for establishing the analyticity of the upper field and the upper layer DNO. Our strategy is to first remove the phase from our governing equations in $\S 2.2$, introduce a domain--flattening change of variables in $\S2.4$, and then seek solutions as a joint Taylor series in two small perturbation variables: an interfacial deformation $(\S2.4)$ and a frequency deformation $(\S2.5)$. These lead to the TFE recursions $(\S2.6)$ from which we can use Sobolev space theory to establish analyticity results. The analyticity of the upper field with respect to a single interfacial deformation is established in $\S2.8$ while the joint analyticity in two small perturbations is established in $\S2.9$. The third case for a single frequency deformation follows directly as a special case of Theorem $2.9.2$ and the analyticity of the upper layer DNO is proven in Theorem $2.10.2$. The concluding section of this chapter demonstrates a Fourier--Chebyshev approach for simulating the TFE recursions giving a HOPS/AWE algorithm whose advantageous numerical properties we explore.
