\section{Analyticity of Solutions to Linear Systems}
\label{Sec:Analyticity of solutions}
Following our analysis in Chapters $2$ and $3$, we pursue a jointly
perturbative approach to solving $(4.14)$ based on the assumptions
\bes
g(x) = \Eps f(x),
\quad
\omega = \uomega + \delta \uomega = (1+\delta) \uomega,\ees
where upon performing a join Taylor expansion the DNO $G$ takes the form $(2.52)$ (cf. $\S2.10$) and the DNO $J$ takes the form $(3.39)$ (cf. $\S3.9$).
\bigskip


With this we establish the existence,
uniqueness, and analyticity of solutions to $(4.14)$. To accomplish this we consider systems of linear equations of the form
\be
\label{Eqn:Linear_System:Two_Param}
\bA(\Eps,\delta)\bV(\Eps,\delta) = \bR(\Eps,\delta),
\ee
and show how such equations can be solved by regular perturbation theory.
