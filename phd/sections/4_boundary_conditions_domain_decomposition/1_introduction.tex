\section{Introduction}
\label{intro:chapter 4 introduction}
This chapter combines the analysis performed in Chapters $2$ and $3$ to fully establish the existence, uniqueness, and analyticity of solutions to our scattering problem.  In $\S4.2$ we summarize the equations which govern the propagation of linear waves in a two-dimensional periodic structure, and discuss how the far--field boundary conditions can be enforced through the use of Transparent Boundary Conditions. Then in
$\S4.3$ we restate our governing equations in terms of interfacial quantities via a Non--Overlapping Domain Decomposition phrased in terms of the DNOs from Chapters $2$ and $3$. In $\S4.4$ we present a rather general and rigorously justifiable perturbative scheme for solving systems of linear systems of equations in Banach spaces. The appropriate analyticity theorems for a single perturbation parameter and two perturbations parameters are presented and proven in $\S4.5$, respectively. The application of these results to the governing equations presented in $\S4.3$ is made in $\S4.6$ where our novel result (Theorem $4.6.1$) is established. The proof requires several rigorous analyses, and the first of these is given in $\S4.7$ with the analyticity of the surface data. Then, $\S4.8$ presents the invertibility of the linearized operator representing the flat--interface solution. The bulk of the analysis has previously been performed in Chapters $2$ and $3$ where we established the analyticity of the transformed fields with a single, geometric, boundary perturbation, $\Eps$, alone in Theorems $2.8.4$ and $3.7.1$. The joint analyticity of the transformed fields was proven in Theorems $2.9.2$ and $3.8.1$ and the analyticity of the DNOs in Theorems $2.10.2$ and $3.9.2$.
