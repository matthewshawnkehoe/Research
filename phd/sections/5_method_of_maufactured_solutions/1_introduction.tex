\section{Introduction}
\label{intro:chapter 5 introduction}

Verification of codes that numerically approximate solutions of partial differential equations entails establishing that the code is free of coding mistakes and capable of reaching exact mathematical solutions given appropriate discretization \cite{roache2019method,salari2000code}. This necessitates the assessment of discretization errors using well--known benchmark solutions. Exact analytical solutions with a sufficiently complicated solution structure are the ideal benchmarks; they don't have to be physically realistic because verification is a purely mathematical endeavor. The \gls{mms} describes a simple and general procedure for producing such solutions and we now focus on applying the MMS to our HOPS/AWE algorithm.
