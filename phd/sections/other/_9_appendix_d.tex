The proof of joint analyticity and computation of the Reflectivity Map, including the related algorithms
and numerical experiments, are submitted to two separate SIAM journals, which allows authors to
use their articles in their thesis. Their policy states “Figures or tables created by someone other than the author or borrowed from a previously published source, even those created by the author and published elsewhere, must carry an appropriate credit line at the end of the caption.” The full policy is available at
\href{https://epubs.siam.org/journal-authors}{\color{blue}https://epubs.siam.org/journal-authors}. Upon acceptance, the author will update the necessary chapters and give the appropriate credit to the respective journal.
