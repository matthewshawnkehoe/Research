\section{Computational Complexity}
\label{Sec: Computational Complexity}

One of the fundamental reasons for developing our HOPS/AWE algorithm is its advantageous computational complexity for problems within its domain of applicability.
In comparison with other classical methods, our HOPS/AWE approach has several advantages for computing quantities such as the Reflectivity Map, $R=R(\varepsilon,\delta)$. To demonstrate this we begin
by fixing the problem of computing $R$ for $N_{\Eps}$ many values of 
$\Eps$ and $N_{\delta}$ many values of $\delta$.

In the case of computing the DNOs $G$ and $J$, we recall from $\S 2.11$ and $\S 3.10$ that our HOPS/AWE algorithm requires
$N_x \times N_z$ unknowns at every perturbation order, $(n,m)$, corresponding to
the $N_x$ equally--spaced gridpoints in the lateral direction and the $N_z + 1$ collocation points in the vertical dimension. In $\S 4.5$ we saw that we could write our scattering problem as $\bA(\Eps,\delta) \bV(\Eps,\delta) = \bR(\Eps,\delta)$ where
\bes
    \bA(\Eps,\delta)=\sumn \summ \bA_{n,m}\Eps^n\delta^m, \quad \bR(\Eps,\delta) = \sumn \summ \bR_{n,m}\Eps^{n}\delta^m,
\ees
and
\bes
\label{Eqn:Soln:Two_Param_Append}
\bV(\Eps,\delta) = \sumn \summ \bV_{n,m}\Eps^{n}\delta^m.
\ees
At order $\mathcal{O}(\Eps^n,\delta^m)$ this becomes
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\bA_{0,0}\bV_{n,m}=&~\bR_{n,m}-\sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1}\bA_{n-\ell,0}\bV_{\ell,m}-\sum_{r=0}^{m-1}\bA_{0,m-r}\bV_{n,r}\\&
-\sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1}\sum_{r=0}^{m-1}\bA_{n-\ell,m-r}\bV_{\ell,r}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
A careful study of $(7.6)$
reveals that the computational complexity of forming the
right--hand side at order $(n,m)$ is
\bes
\BigOh{n m N_x \log(N_x) N_z \log(N_z)}.
\ees
Inverting the operator $\bA_{0,0}$ has complexity $\BigOh{N_x \log(N_x) N_z \log(N_z)}$
so the full cost of computing the $\bV_{n,m}$, 
$\{ 0 \leq n \leq N, 0 \leq m \leq M \}$, is
\bes
\BigOh{N^2 M^2 N_x \log(N_x) N_z \log(N_z)}.
\ees
Once these coefficients are recovered, the cost of summing the series in 
$(\Eps,\delta)$ is minimal, provided it is done in an efficient manner 
(e.g., by Horner's rule \cite{BurdenFaires,AtkinsonHan01}). Our algorithm then 
requires an additional $\BigOh{N_{\Eps} N_{\delta}}$ steps to sum 
over every value of $(\Eps,\delta)$, therefore the full cost of 
computing the Reflectivity Map by our HOPS/AWE method is
\be
\BigOh{N^2 M^2 N_x \log(N_x) N_z \log(N_z) + N_{\Eps} N_{\delta}}.
\ee
In contrast, for a single $(\Eps,\delta)$ pair, a Boundary Integral Method solver with $N_x$ lateral
gridpoints requires time proportional to $\BigOh{N_x^3}$ for Gaussian elimination
to solve the resulting dense system of $N_x$ equations in $N_x$ unknowns
\cite{BurdenFaires,AtkinsonHan01,ColtonKress13}. Applying this 
$N_{\Eps} \times N_{\delta}$ times results in a total computational complexity of
\be
\BigOh{N_x^3 N_{\Eps} N_{\delta}}.
\ee
Thus, once $N_{\Eps}$ and $N_{\delta}$ become large, e.g.,

\bes
N_{\Eps} N_{\delta} > \frac{N^2 M^2 N_x \log(N_x) N_z \log(N_z)}{N_x^3},
\ees
our new algorithm becomes far more efficient. We speculate that the cost of $(7.7)$ could be reduced to
\be
\BigOh{N M \log(NM)N_x \log(N_x) N_z \log(N_z) + N_{\Eps} N_{\delta}},
\ee
provided that we develop a more efficient method of computing the $\bV_{n,m}$, 
$\{ 0 \leq n \leq N, 0 \leq m \leq M \}$, such as reducing the problem space at every step. Alternative approaches to layered media problems have also been proposed by other authors \cite{bai2004reduction,chew2005fast}, including interpolation \cite{atkins2010fast} and Green's function \cite{konno2016fast}.

\textbf{Predictions:} The combination of implementing parallel programming techniques (through, e.g., OpenMP or CUDA) and reducing the problem space at every step will greatly enhance the speed and fidelity of our HOPS/AWE algorithm. Considering the natural advantage surface methods have over conventional methods, such as finite difference, finite element, and spectral element methods, we expect that our HOPS/AWE algorithm will be among the most competitive available for periodic layered media problems.
