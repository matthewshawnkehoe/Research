This thesis establishes a novel HOPS/AWE algorithm that is particularly well suited to simulating scattering returns for periodic media problems. Our main contribution is that of Theorem $4.6.1$ which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a system of partial differential equations which model the interaction of linear waves in periodic layered structures with respect to multiple perturbation parameters. Through the introduction of DNOs and a change of variables based on the TFE methodology, we have shown that solutions to the Helmholtz problem are jointly analytic with respect to both interfacial and frequency perturbations. As a result, our HOPS/AWE algorithm is able to handle a variety of numerical simulations that are physically challenging in both the TE and TM polarization modes. Moreover, our extensive numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, speed, and robustness expected of all HOPS methods.
